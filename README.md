# River raid java

Hi, I'm working on this project for my college with a class bud. It's not meant to be a 1:1 replica of the original; the idea is to test our Java knowledge and our ability to reuse some of the code found in the book "A Lógica do Jogo - Recriando Clássicos da História dos Videogames." I hope this is useful for you.
